## Algorithm for determining and generating the UAV landing trajectory

This project is aimed at developing a program / algorithm for the trajectory of an UAV aircraft to perform routes in case of emergency situations during the creation of an aircraft. The algorithm will help in choosing a landing site and finding an Australian trajectory.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    NumPy
    SciPy
    Matplotlib
    scikit-learn

Installing

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/aircraft-emergency-landing-trajectory.git

    Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

The main algorithm is implemented in emergency_landing.py. You can run it with the following command:

python emergency_landing.py

Acknowledgments

    This project was inspired by the need for emergency landing trajectory density algorithm.
    Thanks to SciPy and scikit-learn for their useful libraries.
